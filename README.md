# Supplemental Data for "Using symbolic transfer entropy to infer which age groups drive influenza transmission from influenza-like illness data", by S.M. Kissler, C. Viboud, B.T. Grenfell, and J.R. Gog

These twelve data files entitled "band*.csv" provide the symbolized ILI time series for the 12 age groups from the SDI-IMS dataset using a symbolization length of m = 3 weeks. Each file contains 884 time series (one for each city) consisting of 494 symbols (3-week groupings) each. The symbols are represented as integers; with reference to Fig. S1, the mapping from integers to symbols is
1: A
2: B
3: C
4: D
5: E
6: F

The age groups are defined as follows:
Band 1: <2
Band 2: 2-4
Band 3: 5-9
Band 4: 10-14
Band 5: 15-19
Band 6: 20-29
Band 7: 30-39
Band 8: 40-49
Band 9: 50-59
Band 10: 60-69
Band 11: 70-79
Band 12: 80+

The file 'datemap.csv' defines the mapping from week index to date. Each date in 'datemap.csv' represents the first day of the week that begins the three-week interval captured by the symbol.
